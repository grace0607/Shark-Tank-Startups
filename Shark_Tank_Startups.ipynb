        "##My Questions\n",
        "In my project, I am curious about whether female contestants (founders) end up settling for less favorable deals (investments) compared to male contestants. Apologies in advance for being gender binary- I am working with the two groups for the purpose of analytical simplicity!\n",
        "\n",
        "So my questions are:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   Is there a difference in the final deal amount, deal equity, and deal valuation that male vs. female contestants end up winning on average?\n",
        "\n",
        "2.   What about the original ask amount, original offered equity, and requested valuation before the final judging?\n",
        "  *   If so, is that where the difference in final deal terms stems from?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*Quick blurb on VC investments*\n",
        "\n",
        "What makes a VC deal favorable from the perspective of an entrepreneur? In general, the goal is to get the most amount of funding for the least percentage of equity. This ensures that your company is getting a high valuation. For example, if the entrepreneur is getting ```$```100,000 for 10```%``` equity, ```$```100,000 is 10% of the company's valuation. So the company is being valued at ```$```1 million (```$```100,000 x 10). The lower the equity and higher the funding amount, the higher the valuation. You can read more about it [here](https://technical.ly/startups/valuation-meaning-shark-tank/).\n",
        "\n",
        "## My Hypotheses\n",
        "1. I hypothesize that **there will be a difference in the final deal terms** (deal amount, deal equity, and deal valuation) between male and female contestants.\n",
        "2. However, I hypothesize that **there will NOT be a difference in the original/requested deal terms** that contestants pitch for initially.\n",
        "  *   Perhaps female contestants end up settling for less favorable deals because they negotiate less agressively than their male counterparts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Data\n",
        "I use a [Shark Tank US dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thirumani/shark-tank-us-dataset) that has data from season 1 to season 12. It contains information about the startup, industry, entrepreneur's name, gender, city as well as deal statistics such as original and final deal amount ($), deal equity (%), and deal valuation ($). It also contains information about amount invested per \"shark\" (or judge) among many others. The dataset contains 52 columns and 1006 rows.\n",

        "To test my idea of female startup founders ending up with less favorable VC deals, I compared the deal amount, deal equity, and deal valuation that male and female contestants end up winning during the final bid. Here, I actually came to the conclusion that female founders ended up with less favorable deals compared to male founders.\n",

        "My hypothesis was that this might be due to factors in between the initial pitch and the final bid such as negotiation. To test this hypothesis, I examined the difference between the original ask amount, original offered equity, and requested valuation among the two genders. If there was no difference in the original pitch, my hypothesis could have held true. Contrary to my hypothesis, we found out that the difference in final deal terms stem from the original pitch. Women founders tend to ask for less money, are willing to give up more equity, and think their startups are worth less than male founders.\n",
        "\n",
        "Is this is the reason why female-founded startups end up getting less favorable investments? Well, we need more conditions to be fulfilled in order to establish a causal relationship. However, the fact that female founders underpitch (or male founders overpitch) their startups can provide some food for thought.\n",

        "Some basic [research](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/07/14/why-vcs-should-invest-in-female-founded-companies-and-upgrade-the-venture-ecosystem/?sh=7f084ac15606) tells me that female founders have proven to be more capital efficient and performance driven than male founders. In fact, businesses founded by women have been found to earn more than twice as much per dollar invested than those founded by men. If this is true, investors are missing out if they don't invest in women. It also means that female founders can be more confident in their abilities and should ask for more than just what they need, but \"[what is needed to flourish.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2022/11/30/why-female-founders-still-arent-getting-the-big-number-investments-and-why-they-should/?sh=248e50bf2761)\"\n"
